## Description
<!-- 
  Explain what this is about, try to use full sentences, and make your point clear.
-->
I would like a ouija board module which allows members of a guild within
a channel to populate the answer to a question. The play style should be 
similar to what is found on the Reddit r/AskOuija implementation.

## Interface
<!--
  In some cases you may wish to propose an interface or module/command
  names to give an idea on how this will be used by users.
  This could be typed up, or "simulated" with another user with a screenshot.
-->
```
User A: $ouija "Vaccines don’t kill children. _ kills children."
   Bot: You asked Ouija: Vaccines don’t kill children. _ kills children.
User B: $ouija submit P
User C: $ouija submit C
User D: $ouija submit s
User C: $ouija goodbye
   Bot: Ouija answered: Vaccines don’t kill children. PCs kills children.
```
