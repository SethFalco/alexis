## About Me
I'm a general purpose Discord bot with various functionality and integrations with many 
popular games and services like Twitch, Steam and RuneScape. I also perform many 
functions in guilds to help manage and automate management or encourage activity.

You can get even more information about me on my character profile on [Notebook.ai][nb.ai]!
